# Spotify Clone built in Next.js using Prisma, Styled-components, Typescript.

The project is still unfinished. I have a lot of code work to do!

# Project description

My goal was to create a copy of Spotify, I'm currently in a very early stage of development. The appearance of the website itself will also be changed after all work related to the operation of the website is completed.
In the current version that you will find in this repository, you can create your account, log in, view your liked playlists and create playlists, but just creating playlists will not work because we do not have any songs added to the site.

# How to run

Download repository, unpack.

Use command: cd project next npm run dev!
